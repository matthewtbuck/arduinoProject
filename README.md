# arduinoProject

For this project, I used two inputs: a potentiometer and a 4x4 keypad. The output for the project is an 16x2 LCD. The potentiometer is used to control the voltage going from the Arduino into the LCD, the keypad is used by the user in order to input the password, and the LCD is used as the main display for the circuit. From a creative standpoint, there are various applications for something like this. With a bit of tweaking, this could be used to lock and unlock a safe that uses a keypad. A more advanced version of this code could also be used as a keyless entry for a house or car. When I have more time to tinker, I also intend to build this particular circuit in real life, as I have the materials for it. 

To use this circuit, one merely has to turn the arduino on. Upon bootup, the arduino will display "Passcode?" at which point you are able to being inputting numbers onto the keypad. If you guess the correct passcode, the LCD will return "Correct!"
